    <div id="content">
      Eve grew up in the thumb of Michigan surrounded by the animals on her
      family's farm and the shores of Lake Huron. Looking up to artists such as
      Teal Blake, Mark Maggiori, and Will James, Eve continues to progress as an
      aspiring self-taught artist. Her biggest hope is that others may see the
      fine details of the ranching and farming way of life through her art.
      Eve's medium of choice is pen and ink.
